These files were part of an experiment to study deleted audio file decay on a digital voice recorder. 10 files were originally created, then deleted, then additional activity was performed using the device. Fragments of four of the 10 files survived and were recovered, the fragments from several of the files were saved as new files with MP3 extensions, and the recovered fragments were playable as MP3 files. See paper at AES 2017, and thanks to the paper reviewer for noting that I did not need to add the MP3 header.
