These files were part of an experiment to study deleted audio file decay on a digital voice recorder. 10 files were originally created, then deleted, then additional activity was performed using the device. Fragments of four of the 10 files survived and were recovered, a generic MP3 header extracted from an intact but different file on the same device was prepended to the fragments and saved as an MP3 file.
