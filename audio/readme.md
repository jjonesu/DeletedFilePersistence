These files were part of an experiment to study deleted audio file decay on a digital voice recorder. 10 files were originally created, then deleted, then additional activity was performed using the device. Fragments of four of the 10 files survived and were recovered. The fragments from these files were saved as new files with MP3 extensions, and the recovered fragments were played as MP3 files. Three of the files contained segments of the original recordings (two with music and one low level background noise, the same as the original). The fourth set of recovered fragments did not contain audio content (the sectors were unchanged, they were just empty in the original file as well). See paper at AES 2017 (Jones, J. "Deleted Audio File Decay on a Digital Voice Recorder"), and thanks to the paper reviewer for noting that I did not need to add the MP3 header.
